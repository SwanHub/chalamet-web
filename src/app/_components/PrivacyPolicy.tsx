          I created this project 100% just for fun, experimenting with a few new
          tools: OpenAI&apos;s CLIP model, Roboflow for inference and model
          hosting, Vercel for site deployment, and Supabase as a database with
          native vector embedding support.

        <li>This project is non-commercial - for the love of the game.</li>

          I have absolutely nothing to do with Anthony Po (organizer of the
          original lookalike contest in NYC) or Knicks superfan Timoth√©e
          Chalamet.

          All the data is anonymous. The only stuff I&apos;m storing are the
          things you see - images, vector embeddings, comparison scores and
          up/downvotes.
